# APIs
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) são componentes criados em diversas linguagens de programação e disponibilizados em diversos formatos e plataformas, permitindo que os desenvolvedores criem soluções complexas a partir de pequenas funcionalidades complexas, outrora criadas com toda a complexidade da regra de negócio requerida, onde o seu consumo e uso  em are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

Web APIs
When writing code for the Web, there are a large number of Web APIs available. Below is a list of all the APIs and interfaces (object types) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site.

Web APIs are typically used with JavaScript, although this doesn't always have to be the case.

HTTP APIs


REST APIs
REST
REST (Representational State Transfer) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.

The basic idea of REST is that a resource, e.g. a document, is transferred via well-recognized, language-agnostic, and reliably standardized client/server interactions. Services are deemed RESTful when they adhere to these constraints.

HTTP APIs in general are sometimes colloquially referred to as RESTful APIs, RESTful services, or REST services, although they don't necessarily adhere to all REST constraints. Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be called using standard web libraries and tools.

An API is simply code that is pre-written to enable interoperability between diverse systems and software. 
In using APIs, no one has to understand how the system on the other side actually functions. 
APIs allow anyone to access those systems with only working knowledge of the API itself. 

This is in contrast to the integration technologies of the past, in which custom programs had to be created for each integration use case.
APIs offer a much faster and easier way to connect diverse systems. This is becoming increasingly important for companies which are, or want to become, software-driven businesses. Consumer facing applications, public cloud, and mobile applications are all driving growth in API usage, as are social media and the Internet.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third-party software or hardware.

In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third-party websites and services.
